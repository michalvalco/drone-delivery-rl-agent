## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Import Error Resolution
**Problem:** `from agents.dqn_agent` (incorrect directory name)  
**Solution:** Changed to `from agent.dqn_agent` in `train.py` and `evaluate.py`

### 2. Code Consolidation
**Problem:** Duplicate ReplayBuffer implementation  
**Solution:** Integrated into `dqn_agent.py`, kept `replay_buffer.py` as reference

### 3. Documentation Accuracy
**Problem:** README claimed 128→128→64 architecture  
**Solution:** Updated to accurately reflect 128→128 implementation

### 4. Enhanced Features
- Added success rate tracking
- Improved logging output
- Better error messages
- Performance grading in evaluation
- Directory creation in training script

python train.py --episodes 500

# Full training (2000 episodes, ~1 hour)
python train.py --episodes 2000 --save-freq 500 --experiment homework_run
```

### Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate the trained agent
python evaluate.py --model models/dqn_agent_final.pth --episodes 20
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest test.py -v

## 🎯 Demonstration Script

For quick demonstration during grading/presentation:

```bash
# 1. Show the environment
python -c "from environment import DroneDeliveryEnv; env = DroneDeliveryEnv(render_mode='human'); env.reset(); print('Environment initialized!')"

# 2. Run tests
pytest test.py -v --tb=short

# 3. Train briefly (or show existing model)
python train.py --episodes 100 --render-freq 10

# 4. Evaluate
python evaluate.py --model models/dqn_agent_final.pth --episodes 5
```
